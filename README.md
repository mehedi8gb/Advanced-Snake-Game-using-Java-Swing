## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started with this Java project.

# Snake Game

A classic arcade game now available in a sleek and simple Java Swing GUI. This nostalgic game will transport you back to the days of arcade gaming with its retro-style graphics and addictive gameplay.

## Objective

The goal of the game is to guide the snake to eat as many apples as possible without crashing into the walls or its own tail. The snake will grow longer with each apple eaten, making the gameplay increasingly challenging. The game also features a high-score system, so you can compete with yourself or with your friends to see who can achieve the highest score.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
